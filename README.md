## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the **Microsoft 365 Defender Advanced Hunting** portal: https://security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting  
2. Paste a query from this repo into the editor.  
3. Adjust as needed:
   - **Time ranges** (`ago(7d)`, `ago(30d)`, etc.)
   - **Filters** (device groups, accounts, file paths)
   - **Output** (summaries vs. raw events)
4. Run the query and analyze results.

## üß± Standard Query Header

Use this header block at the top of each `.kql` file to keep things consistent:

```kusto
// Title: <Short descriptive name>
// Purpose: <What this query helps you find or decide>
// Scope: <Windows 11 / Server 2016+ / All Windows / etc.>
// Tables: <DeviceEvents, DeviceRegistryEvents, AlertInfo, DeviceTvm* ...>
// Tunables:
//   - Time range: change `ago(7d)` as needed
//   - Filters: device groups, account names, file paths, etc.
